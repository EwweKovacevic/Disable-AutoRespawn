# Disable-AutoRespawn
Easily disable the autorespawn that FiveM comes with by default.

## Warning
This won't respawn/revive you unless you have a different script for respawning/reviving, this script is barely tested so there might be bugs, if there are bugs just join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eJfgfFtZ2r) and open a ticket.
